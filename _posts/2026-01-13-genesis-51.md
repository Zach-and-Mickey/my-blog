**Genesis 50:24** *And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”*

I talked a few days ago about how Joseph trusted God through the bad times. Today, this verse stood out to me for the opposite reason. Joseph has been a well respected leader in Egypt and has been blessed with many offspring and a long life, but he didn't get complacent. He remembered God's promise to his ancestors and longed for it. It could have been easy for Egypt to feel like the promised land for Joseph, but he knew God had another plan. Most of us have it so easy in our lives compared to what some people around the world go through. I know I am guilty of complacency when it seems like things are going well, but what am I missing out on by not seeking to follow God's plan.
