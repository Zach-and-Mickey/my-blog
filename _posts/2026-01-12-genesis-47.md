title: The Salvation of Israel
subtitle: Genesis 47:12

**Genesis 47:12** *And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their dependents.*

Everything that has happened to Joseph throughout his life has led to this point. He is in a position to save his father and his entire household from the severe famine. Even though Joseph went through some tough times in slavery and prison, all those things had to happen to accomplish the salvation of God's chosen people. We can't always see how God is working. It can be confusing, and in some cases it can cause us to doubt. But as [Romans 8:28](https://biblehub.com/esv/romans/8-28.htm) says, "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose." Notice that it does not say, "only good things happen to those who love God". Bad things still happen, but God uses the bad things to grow, strengthen, and prepare us.
