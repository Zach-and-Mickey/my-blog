title: Who Am I?
subtitle: Exodus 3:11-12

**Exodus 3:11-12** *But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” He said, “But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”*

God comes to Moses and tells him to go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt. Moses' first question is, paraphrasing, "Why me? Why do you think I am the right person for the job?" God simply answers, "But i will be with you." It was never about Moses being capable. He never would have been capable on his own. God has things for us to do too. But we can't let it be about us or we will always be full of doubt. Trust that God is with you and allow Him to work through you.

>**[Ephesians 2:10](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm)** *For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.*
