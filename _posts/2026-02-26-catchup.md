subtitle: Eliminating Sin

I haven't posted in a while but I have been reading. One of the main themes that I have seen over and over again over the last month is the seriousness of sin. God takes sin so seriously that he commanded the Israelites to stone those who did certain things. Some nations were being wiped out from the land because of their sins. I haven't been taking my sins seriously enough. I need to be more active in searching out my sins and eliminating them.
