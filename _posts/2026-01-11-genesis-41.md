title: Humility before Others
subtitle: Genesis 41:16
---
**Genesis 41:16** *Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”*

Joseph immediately denied his supposed ability to interpret dreams. He also immediately gives God the credit. It would have been easy for Joseph to claim that he had supernatural abilities because the Egyptians already believed that certain people were gifted. Pharaoh had already asked all the magicians and wise men. Joseph would have gotten some recognition and praise if he claimed he had the ability to interpret dreams, but the reason Pharoah puts him in charge is because he has the "Spirit of God" in him. Joseph's humility ultimately led to his exaltation.

John the Baptist states in John 3:30 that Jesus must increase while he decreases. We need to keep this in mind. God blesses us and we should not take credit for what we have. The only way we have anything is if it was given to us by God. 

>**[Proverbs 18:12](https://biblehub.com/esv/proverbs/18-12.htm)** *Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor.*
