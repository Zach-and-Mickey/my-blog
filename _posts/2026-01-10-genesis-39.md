title: God's Faithfulness
subtitle: Genesis 39:2
---
**Genesis 39:2** *“The Lord was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.”*

 **Genesis 39:21** *“But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.”*

In Joseph's situation, it might would be hard to see God's faithfulness. He kept doing the right thing but was ending up in bad situations. Yet it is stated in several places how the Lord was with him. All we can do is follow God, we can't know where that will put us. Sometimes we will be at odds with people because of our faith. Know that God will be with you and take comfort in that.

>**[1 Peter 3:14](https://biblehub.com/esv/1_peter/3.htm)** *But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear what they fear; do not be shaken.”*
