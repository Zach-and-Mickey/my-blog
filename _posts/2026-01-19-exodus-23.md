title: Patience in God's Timing
subtitle: Exodus 23:29-30

**Exodus 23:29-30** *I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the wild beasts multiply against you. Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and possess the land.*

I would describe myself as a pretty patient person when it comes to adversity or things that others might find annoying, but I struggle with patience when it seems like things aren't moving along. I often want an answer from God mor quickly or I want to see progress. But I need to trust God's wisdom and know that He knows what to give me and when. I need to be faithful with what I have and focus on the moment.

>**[Jeremiah 29:13](https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm)** *“One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.*

>**[Isaiah 30:18](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-18.htm)** *Therefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you. For the LORD is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.*
