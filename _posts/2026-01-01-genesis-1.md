title: Don't Be a Cain
subtitle: Genesis 4
---
**Genesis 4:3-7** *In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground, and Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat portions. And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his face fell. The Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry, and why has your face fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted?*

It is natural to read the story of Cain and think about how awful Cain is. How he killed his brother over something so small. That is normally how I see it, but this time, I was struck by how Cain-like I can be. I don't give the Lord my best. Then I get upset when it seems God isn't listening or doing anything for me. But if I do well, will I not be accepted?

Now we don't bring offerings of food or animals anymore, but we are called to tithe. We are also called to present our bodies as living sacrifices. This is what it means to give your best. As Romans 6 says, "offer your members to God as instruments for righteousness."

>**Romans 6:13** *but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.*
>**Romans 12:1** *I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.*
