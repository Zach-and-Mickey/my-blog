title: Trust and Cry Out
subtitle: 1 Chronicles 5:20
----
> **1 Chronicles 5:20** *And because they cried out to God in battle, they were helped against their enemies, and the Hagrites and all their allies were delivered into their hands. Because they put their trust in God, He answered their prayers.*

It's been a while. I got off track for a little bit but I am catching up now. I have made it to 1 Chronicles. The Chronicles can be hard to read through because it is mostly a bunch of names and numbers. It kinda seems unimportant. But then there are verses like this one scattered throughout. This verse is such a good reminder for me. All of us are in a battle against spiritual forces and need to cry out to God for victory over the devil and his minions. The second part of this is key and is also mentioned in other passages. Not only do we need to cry out, we need to trust in God. 

>**James 1:6-7** *But he must ask in faith, without doubting, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.*
