subtitle: Exodus 13:21-22

**Exodus 13:21-22** *And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might travel by day and by night. The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.*

Often times, I ask God for guidance only when I have a big decision and I don't know what to do. That isn't the place God should have in my life though. WIth the Israelites, He didn't just show up to guide them across the Red Sea and then disappear again. He was with them the entire time they were in the wilderness. God should guide every aspect of my life. We now have the Holy Spirit which the cloud and the pillar represent. The Holy Spirit is always with us and will always give guidance if we seek and allow it.

>**[Matthew 28:20](https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm)** *And behold, I am with you <u>**always**</u>, to the end of the age.*
