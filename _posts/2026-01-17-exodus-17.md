title: Crying Out to God
subtitle: Exodus 17:4
---
**Exodus 17:4** *So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.”*

The Hebrew phrase here for cried out often has a connotation of crying out in distress and it presents itself as Moses being desparate. He was desparate to know what God would have him do. I do not feel this same sense of desparation. My prayers have not been emotional or eager lately. I know I need to cry out and I know I need to be desparate to hear from God but it isn't happening right now.

>**[Jeremiah 29:13](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-13.htm)** *You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.*
