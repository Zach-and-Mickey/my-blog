title: Deuteronomy 11:1-7

**Verses 2-3:** *Know this day—for I don’t speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm, his signs, and his works, which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;*

**Verse 7:** *but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh’s great work which he did.*

It is so easy for me, especially when reading the Bible, to worship God because of the things that I'm reading about. To worhsip God because he brought the Israelites out of Egypt, or to love Jesus and worship Him because of the miracles we see in the New Testament. But this is not the correct perspective. It is okay to worship God because of those things, but I also need to realize that God didn't just exist a long time ago. He exists now, and He is still just as powerful. I need to worship God because of the things I have seen Him do in my own life. My "eyes have seen all of Yahweh's great work which he did."
