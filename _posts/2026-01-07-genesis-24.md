title: Submitting to God's Sovereignt Plan
subtitle: Genesis 24:50
---
**Genesis 24:50** *Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing has come from the Lord; we cannot speak to you bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.”*

When Abraham's servant asks how they will responed to his request to take Rebekah as a wife for Isaac, Laban and Bethuel simply answer that it is the Lord's will. It came from the Lord, so what can they say about it. This type of submission is something with which I struggle. There have been times in which I knew I was called to do something and I chose not to do it. Either because it didn't fit with my plan, or I didn't think it would work. I need to submit as soon as I recognize that something is coming from the Lord. Ultimately God's plan is going to work out. It's only a matter of whether I am going to help or get in the way.

>**Isaiah 55:8-9** *For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.*

>**Proverbs 19:21** *Many plans are in a man’s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.*
