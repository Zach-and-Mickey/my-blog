Hello, everybody! Just a little introduction for today. I am a male in my early 20s who is reading through the Bible this year. I have done it before, but the last few years I have not been committed. I go through seasons of commitment and hunger followed by seasons of complete lack of interest. 
This blog is an attempt to keep me on track through the year and I would encourage all of you to follow along with me. The basic reading plan is one that my pastor follows. I will read three chapters every day with the exception of Sunday, which will be 5 chapters. Following this plan, we end up finishing in one year. I have already started and am currently in Deuteronomy but feel free to start alongisde me wherever I'm at. Today's reading is Deuteronomy 6-8. My first real post will most likely be Saturday where I will try to have some actual content about what I've read for the week and what God has shown me through it. Thanks for reading.
