title: Changed By God's Spirit
subtitle: 1 Samuel 10:6-7
---

1 Samuel 10:6-7 "Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be changed into a different man. And it shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion requires, because God is with you." NASB

I often struggle with verses like these. When I became a Christian, I didn't experience a rush of the Spirit's power, or a drastically different lifestyle. I was young, so I was not caught up in any really bad situations or habits, but I struggle with not feeling like I really changed all that much. Shouldn't an experience with the most powerful being in the universe be a little bit more meaningful. My only assurance of salvation is that I know God has directly answered my prayers in the past. So I will continue to pray for the power of the Holy Spirit to be evident in my life. 

On the other hand, verse 7 is a very encouraging verse. God is with you so do the work that is before you and God will help you to succeed.
