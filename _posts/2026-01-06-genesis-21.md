**Genesis 21:19** *Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.*

I am sometimes guilty of thinking that God is not providing. But maybe he is and I am just not seeing it. The verse doesn't say that God created a well for her to get water from, but that He opened her eyes so that she could see the well that was already there. We see God doing similar things in other places in Scripture as well. One instance is when God opens the eyes of Elisha's servant to see the army. God please open my eyes so I can see the ways that you are providing and taking care of me.

>**2 Kings 6:17-20** *And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.*
