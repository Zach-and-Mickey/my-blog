title: In Our Hearts
subtitle: Deuteronomy 30:14

Deuteronomy 30:14  "But the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may obey it."

This verse shows me several things that need to be true about how I use the Bible.

1. "It is in your mouth." I need to be saying words from the Bible daily. That could be in reciting passages and trying to memorize or in having conversations about it with other people.
2.  "It is in your heart." According to the Berean Study Bible, "The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions." The Bible needs to be at the center of everything I do, every decision I make, and it should influence my desires and emotions.

Many people fall into the trap of thinking that the act of getting saved is going to automatically turn their lives around. The Holy Spirit does have the power to transform, but it is also important for us to take an active role in our salvation. Reading the Bible, meditating on it, and allowing it to change how we live, in conjunction with the work of the Holy Spirit, is how we will grow to become mature in our faith.
